# **Notice**

- The use of Bloodborne SDK means that you agree and acknowledge the fact that it is against VRChat's ToS. I will not be held responsible for any bans that might occurr, use at your own risk.
- If you are worried about me logging your information, then please rest assured. I will never log any personal information from you and my dynamic link library does not hold any rat or malware. I will never attack any user that uses the modified SDK, you are in safe hands.
- If something isn't available, it's because it's either considered private or still in development, meaning that only alpha or beta testers have access to the specific feature.
- If you want to share the package, then please redirect people to the official discord server, [ΛCE ΛSIN™](https://discord.gg/U8vHS7y), so that they may download from the respected source.
