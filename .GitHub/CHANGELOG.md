Fixed users not being able to upload past 10 MB on version 2.22.0. Simply forgot to make an important change for the bypass. The mistake was only made on version 2.22.0, older releases and newer releases will work fine.

Made improvements to the Quest upload limiter state behavior. It will now display the correct upload limiter toggle depending on the user's permissions. It will also display the correct text on the builder, depending on if permissions have changed for the current user.

The same state behavior improvements have been implemented for Discord RPC toggles, highly optimized and without having to create more preferences.

Added the ability to show or hide settings due to their increase. There will now be a toggle visibility icon, clicking it will either expand or collapse the entire section. This will greatly improve performance when settings are collapsed since they won't be loaded. EditorPrefs are in use, more preferences had to be created so that the states are saved through different projects.

Changed the order of some settings.

Made changes to the auto-updater. The startup toggle was renamed from Auto Updater to Auto Update. The menu functions to run them have been removed. They are now located on the settings all the way down, where you'll be presented with a new cloud icon. The cloud icon will check for updates when clicked. If you are unable to click the cloud icon, then it means you're up-to-date.

Ace Asin — 11/02/2022

Made changes to the preset accounts, regular users can preset 1 account, server boosters, and premium members are able to preset 2 accounts. If you want to preset an unlimited amount of accounts, then you must become a patron.

Removed the Bloodborne > Discord sub-menu.
Added 1 entry to both Bloodborne > Social and Bloodborne > Support sub-menus.
