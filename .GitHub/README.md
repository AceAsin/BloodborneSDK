## Support

- The project began for personal and educational purposes at first, but it slowly grew and became something greater. Thank you so much to everyone that supports me in any way!
- You can support me by creating a free account, following me on [GitHub](https://github.com/AceAsin) and starring my repositories. If you wish to donate, then please visit [Buy Me A Cofee](https://buymeacoffee.com/aceasin) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/aceasin).

## Notice

- The developer Ace Asin and Bloodborne are in no way, shape, or form affiliated with VRChat Inc. The use of Bloodborne SDK means that you agree and acknowledge the fact that it is against VRChat's [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal) and [Community Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines). I will not be held responsible for any bans that might occur, use at your own risk.
- I am a professional and highly trusted developer that takes privacy and security very seriously. I will never log any personal or sensitive information, at risk of tarnishing my reputation, and the software development kit does not contain anything malicious. I will never attack or harm any user, over any reason, for whatever purpose, please rest assured.

## Important

- The image and video previews have been removed from the repository, since the software development kit is constantly changing and evolving.
- The software development kit saves your settings on a `Setting.asset` file and `EditorPrefs`/`PlayerPrefs`. You can reset the `Setting.asset` file back to default by going to the setting tab on the control panel or by simply deleting the `VRCSDK/Bloodborne/Cache/Setting.asset` file. You can delete the editor preferences by going to your registry editor and deleting all of the keys that begin with `Bloodborne`. It's very important that you only delete keys that begin with `Bloodborne`. The registry paths depending on your operating system can be copied from below. The player preferences can be deleted by going to `Bloodborne>Utility>Clear Cache and PlayerPrefs` or `Bloodborne>Utility>SDK2>Clear Cache and PlayerPrefs`.
