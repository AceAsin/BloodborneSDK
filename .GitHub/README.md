## Help

- Join the [Discord][Discord] server for any questions or concerns. Please create a post on the dedicated support forum channel. Questions asked in inappropriate channels will be ignored and ultimately deleted.

## Download

- The software can be downloaded from the website [Ace Asin](https://aceasin.com/bloodborne).
- If you want to share the software package, then please redirect users to the official website so that they may download the package from the respected source and gain additional information.
- Do not download cracked versions of the software from nefarious users. This will only put you at risk of getting your computer compromised and information stolen.

## Support

- If you would like to purchase merch, then visit the shop at [Ace Asin](https://aceasin.com/shop). Purchases made at the shop help grow the business.
- If you would like to donate, then please visit [Buy Me A Coffee][BuyMeACoffee] or [Ko-Fi][Ko-Fi]. In return for donating, you will receive a cyan-colored lifetime donator role in the server that distinguishes you from others.
- If you would like to subscribe, then consider becoming a patron by visiting my [Patreon][Patreon] page. In return for subscribing, you will receive early access and exclusive content

## Privacy

- The software stores and accesses preferences by using [PlayerPrefs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html) and [EditorPrefs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorPrefs.html).
- The software only performs [**HTTP** `GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) method requests to obtain data from the backend server.

## Important

- The software now resides in **Packages** instead of **Assets** in the form of a custom package.
- The software is capable of exporting from **Packages** and **Assets** since the original **Assets > Export Package...** method was patched by Ace Asin.
