# **FAQ**

1. Where can I download the SDK and where can I support you?
    - The SDK can only be downloaded from my discord server, [ΛCE ΛSIN][Server], at the current time.
    - If you love my work and wish to support me, then I am accepting donations at [PayPal][PayPal], and [Ko-Fi][Ko-Fi]. You can also supoprt me on [Patreon][Patreon] for exclusive features. It is not necessary or mandatory in any way, shape, or form.
2. Is the modified SDK againt VRChat's ToS and is it safe to use?
    - The SDK is against VRChat's ToS.
    - The SDK is considered safe and it's not very likely that you will get banned because of using a modified SDK, there is no way of checking that you are using a modified SDK.
3. What does the SDK do and how does it differ from other modified SDK's?
    - The SDK bypasses all limitations, as well as offers a lot of useful and customizable features. A lot of User Interface (UI) bugs have also been fixed from the original VRChat SDK.
    - The SDK is smaller in size, meaning that importing will be extremely fast. I implemented my Content Delivery Network (CDN), Domain Name System (DNS), Discord Rich Presence (PRC), Remote Configuration and much more.
4. Where can I report a bug?
    - If you find a bug, redirect yourself to my discord server, [ΛCE ΛSIN][Server], where you can speak freely about your issue. I can help you fix any problem that you might encounter.
5. Is the SDK open source?
    - The SDK is obfuscated, at least my library, which includes most of my code. The reason for this is that I don't want other people snooping around and skidding my methods, as well as there might be sensitive data, that I don't want people to see.
6. Can you implement a new feature to the SDK?
    - I am open to suggestions from anyone, but will take into consideration more the requests of Patron's. You can let me know by joining my discord server.
